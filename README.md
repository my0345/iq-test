🧠 Quiz Game Logic

Here’s how the game works step-by-step:

Questions and answers are stored in a JavaScript array in script.js.

Each question object includes:

The question text

Four possible answers

A flag (true/false) for the correct one.

When the user selects an answer:
Correct answers turn green ✅

Wrong answers turn red ❌

The Next button loads the next question.

At the end, the final score is displayed.

The Play Again button restarts the quiz from the beginning.
